Here are some more details about the movie and the Battle of Karbala:
 
The movie is directed by Ahmad Reza Darvish, a Iranian filmmaker who has made several movies on Islamic themes. The movie was released in 2014 and has won several awards and nominations. The movie has a cast of Iranian and Iraqi actors, who portray the historical figures with authenticity and emotion. The movie also uses realistic sets and costumes, as well as special effects and soundtracks, to create a vivid and immersive experience for the viewers.
 
The Battle of Karbala is one of the most important events in the history of Islam, especially for the Shia Muslims, who regard Imam Hussain as their third Imam and leader. The battle was a result of a political and religious conflict between Yazid, who claimed to be the caliph or successor of Prophet Muhammad, and Imam Hussain, who refused to accept his authority. Yazid was known to be a corrupt and oppressive ruler, who violated the teachings and values of Islam. Imam Hussain, on the other hand, was a symbol of justice, piety and courage, who stood up for his principles and defended his rights.
 
Imam Hussain left his hometown of Medina with his family and followers, and headed towards Kufa, a city in Iraq where he had received invitations from the people to come and lead them. However, on his way, he was intercepted by Yazid's army in the desert of Karbala. There, he was surrounded by thousands of soldiers, who cut off his access to water and food. Imam Hussain was offered two options: to surrender to Yazid or to fight. He chose to fight, knowing that he would be martyred along with his companions.
 
The battle lasted for 10 days, from the 2nd to the 10th of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar. Imam Hussain and his 72 companions fought bravely against the overwhelming odds, while enduring thirst and hunger. They faced many hardships and tragedies, such as the death of Imam Hussain's six-month-old son Ali Asghar, who was killed by an arrow while in his father's arms. They also witnessed the betrayal of some of their allies, who switched sides or deserted them. Finally, on the 10th of Muharram, also known as Ashura, Imam Hussain and his remaining companions were killed one by one. Imam Hussain was the last to fall, after being wounded by several arrows and swords. His head was severed from his body and raised on a spear.
 
After the battle, Yazid's army looted the tents of Imam Hussain's family and followers, who were mostly women and children. They also took them as prisoners and marched them from Karbala to Kufa and then to Damascus, where they were humiliated and tortured by Yazid. However, despite all the suffering they endured, they remained steadfast in their faith and loyalty to Imam Hussain. They also exposed the crimes and tyranny of Yazid to the people, who eventually rose up against him and overthrew him.
 
The Battle of Karbala is commemorated every year by millions of Muslims around the world, especially during the first 10 days of Muharram. They mourn the martyrdom of Imam Hussain and his companions by holding ceremonies, processions, lectures and rituals. They also express their love and devotion to Imam Hussain by reciting poems, songs and prayers in his honor. They also reflect on the lessons and values that Imam Hussain taught them through his sacrifice: such as courage, justice, dignity, loyalty and resistance against oppression.
